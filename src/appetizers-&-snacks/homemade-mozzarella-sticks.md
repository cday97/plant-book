## Ingrediants
- 1 ½ cups (106 g) plain Panko
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon table salt
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 lb whole milk mozzarella block or 15 - whole milk string cheese
- Vegetable oil for frying
- [Marinara Sauce](https://4thehalibit.github.io/Westbergs-Cookbook/appetizers-snacks/marinara-sauce.md/)

## Steps

Place panko crumbs in a Ziploc bag and use a rolling pin or mallet to crush until you have fine crumbs.

1 ½ cups (106 g) plain Panko

Pour crushed panko into a shallow dish and add Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, pepper, and salt and stir to combine.

½ teaspoon Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon dried parsley, ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, ¼ teaspoon table salt

In a separate, shallow bowl, crack 2 large eggs and beat with a whisk or the tines of a fork until scrambled.

2 large eggs

Pour all-purpose flour in yet another shallow bowl.

½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour

If using a mozzarella block, cut widthwise into 15 sticks.

1 lb whole milk mozzarella block

Working with one at a time, dip the stick in the flour and shake off any excess flour. Then dip in the beaten egg and let any excess drip off. Finally, dip in panko crumb mixture, making sure the entire cheese stick is coated with panko.

Place a wire cooking rack on a baking sheet and place breaded mozzarella sticks on rack. Once all sticks have been dipped, transfer to the freezer and chill for at least one hour. If you are chilling for longer than 1 hour, after 1 hour remove from freezer and place in an airtight container then return to freezer.

## To Fry
(please see notes section below for instructions for the oven or in the air fryer)

While sticks are still in the freezer, fill a medium-sized saucepan 3” deep with vegetable oil. Attach a thermometer to the side and make sure it is suspended about halfway into the oil (and that it is not touching the bottom of the pot). Heat oil over medium heat until you reach a temperature of 350F (175C) then remove sticks from freezer.

Vegetable oil

Fry sticks, 2 at a time, until golden brown (about 1 minute) then remove to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Make sure oil returns to temperature before frying next batch.

Enjoy while still warm dipped in warmed marinara sauce.


## Notes

### Instructions for baking:
Preheat oven to 415F (210C) and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray lightly with cooking spray. Arrange sticks on baking sheet, spacing at least an inch apart, and bake 10-15 minutes or until they are beginning to turn golden brown (they will not get as dark as they would if deep fried). Enjoy warm dipped in warm marinara. 
### Instructions for air fryer:
Heat air fryer to 390F (200C). Spray the basket of your air fryer with cooking spray. Add sticks and spray lightly with cooking spray. Cook for 6-8 minutes, tossing halfway through, until are golden and crispy. Enjoy warm with warm marinara.
