## Ingredients

+++ 1x

 - 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
 - 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
 - 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
 - 1/8 teaspoon salt
 - 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1 tablespoon canola oil, melted coconut oil or vegan butter
 - 3 tablespoons non-dairy milk
 - 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 - 2 tablespoons dairy free chocolate chips

+++ 2x

 - 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 - 4 tablespoons cocoa powder
 - 4 tablespoons granulated sugar
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
 - 2 tablespoons canola oil, melted coconut oil, or vegan butter
 - 6 tablespoons non-dairy milk
 - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 - 4 tablespoons dairy-free chocolate chips

+++ 3x

 - 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour

 - 6 tablespoons granulated sugar
 - 3/8 teaspoon salt (or 1/4 teaspoon + 1/8 teaspoon)

## Instructions
 1. Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt and baking powder to a mug. Stir or whisk to combine.
 2. Pour in the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla into the mug with the dry ingredients and stir well with a spoon. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.
 3. Cook in the microwave for 40 seconds. It will likely be a little undercooked in the middle at this point, which is my preference, but if you want it cooked more, microwave it another 10-20 seconds. 
 4. Serve immediately.
