## Ingrediants
- 28 ⅕ oz canned cherry tomatoes
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- 14 oz cannellini beans
- 4 Italian sausages
- 3 cups kale chopped
- 1 brown onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 celery
- 2 carrots
- ½ tsp chili flakes
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 1 tsp oregano
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt & Pepper

## Steps
  1.  Dice vegetables into 1cm sized pieces, crush garlic and chop kale
  2.  Cut sausages into bite sized pieces
  3.  In a large pot add olive oil and cook sausages on medium/high heat until browned approx. 3 minutes
  4.  Remove sausages, reduce the heat to medium and cook onion, celery, carrots & garlic for 4 minutes
  5.  Add tinned tomatoes, stock, herbs, spices and simmer for 10 minutes
  6.  Add beans, kale & sausages and simmer for a further 5 minutes
  7.  Serve with some grilled bread


## Tips/Tricks 

    I cut the sausages up before browning them – this way you get bite-sized pieces and the casing keeps them somewhat intact. Alternatively, you can remove from casings and make them into mini meatballs
    you can use any tinned tomatoes but for this recipe, I used tinned cherry tomatoes. If using plum tomatoes you need to chop the tomatoes up before adding them in
    Tuscan stew is freezer friendly so feel free to make double the portion and freeze some for a delicious quick dinner. Alternatively, it will keep for up to 3 days in the fridge
