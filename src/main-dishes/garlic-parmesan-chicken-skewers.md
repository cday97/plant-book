## Ingrediants

   - Chicken Tenders – you can use breast of thighs but I prefer how moist tenders are.
   - Butter – one stick of butter is used.
   - Garlic – lots of garlic is used, about 8-10 cloves
   - Parmesan – grated parm is the best for this recipe as it easily incorporates in the butter sauce.
   - Hot sauce – just a tablespoon to give this chicken a little kick without adding too much heat.
   - Seasonings – paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes
   - Fresh Parsley – the fresh parsley adds the perfect herbiness to balance the savory butter sauce.
   - Don’t forget the wooden skewers!




## Steps

Step 1: Before you start, make sure to soak your wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Start by combining your spice mixture in a small bowl and set aside. Prep your chicken by cutting in 3″ pieces. Place them in a bowl and toss in olive oil and the spices, coating well on all sides. Pack the chicken onto each skewer, making sure they are tightly packed with no space in between to ensure maximum juiciness. If needed, snip the top few inches of the skewers to fit in the air fryer after the chicken is skewered.

Step 2: Make the garlic parmesan sauce by combining all ingredients into a saucepan over low heat. Scoop out 1/3 of the sauce and use that for basting the par-cooked chicken. Reserve the remaining sauce for basting the cooked chicken so you don’t cross contaminate.  

Step 3: Cook 2-3 skewers at a time in an air fryer at 400 degrees for 5 minutes. Remove and flip the skewers and baste with sauce, returning to cook an additional 2 minutes at 400 degrees. Flip them back, baste with more sauce and cook another 5-6 minutes or until the internal temp reaches 165 degrees. A total cook time of 12-14 minutes. Once they are finished cooking, hit them with a final pass of the garlic sauce (the reserved sauce) and sprinkle with some parmesan and serve.
