## Steps

PLEASE NOTE - This schedule is based on a room temperature of 21 °C (70 °F). If your room temperature is warmer then things will happen faster and if it's colder things will happen more slowly so adjust accordingly. Also bear in mind that although I can guide you and give you a rough idea of what to expect and how long each stage will take, it is impossible to be exact. That’s where intuition, experience and judgement comes in. And you only get that by practicing!

 - *7 am* - Feed your starter with 55g of flour and 55g of water. 
 - *2 pm - Mix* - Whisk your starter with the water then add the flour and salt and mix until a shaggy dough is formed with no dry flour visible.
 - *2.10 pm - Autolyse* - Cover with a damp dish towel and leave to rest for 1 hour.
 - *3.10 pm - 1st set of stretch and folds* - Stretch and fold the dough over itself 10 times. Then cover and leave to rest for 1 hour.
 - *4.10 pm - 2nd set of stretch and folds* - Stretch and fold the dough over itself 6 times. Then cover and leave to rest for 1 hour.
 - *5.10 pm - 3rd set of stretch and folds* - Stretch and fold the dough over itself 6 times.
 - *5.15 pm - Bulk ferment* - Cover the dough again and leave until it looks puffy, has risen by about 30% and feels a bit jiggly with lots of bubbles throughout if you look at it from underneath and probably some big bubbles forming on the top and sides too. If you need to go out pop it in the fridge and pick up where you left off whe you get back.
 - *8.15 pm - Preshape* - Once you are satisfied that the bulk ferment is finished, turn out the dough and preshape your loaf. Leave to rest covered on the counter for 30 minutes.
 - *8.50 pm - Final shape* - Shape your loaf and place in the proofing basket.
 - *9 pm - Proof* - Cover the proofing basket with a plastic bag and leave to proof in the fridge over night (although you can probably get away with leaving it up to 24 hours, maybe even 48, depending on how cold your fridge is).
 - *8.00 am* - Remove the loaf from the fridge and leave to warm on the counter until it's looking puffy, has risen by somewhere between 30 and 50% and passes the poke test!
 - *8.15 am Preheat oven* - Place Dutch oven inside oven and preheat to 500 °F (260 °C) for one hour.
 - *9.15 am - Bake* - Carefully place the loaf in the hot Dutch oven and bake for 25 minutes with the lid on. Then remove the lid, turn the temperature down to 450 ° F (232 °C) for another 15 to 20 minutes, until a deep golden brown and when you knock on the bottom of the bread it sounds hollow. 
 - *10.00 am - Cool* - Allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before cutting, but
ideally until completely cool.
