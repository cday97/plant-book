**Wine Note**: The alcohol burns off through simmering and leaves a lovely flavor, but you can omit if you prefer

**Tomatoes Note**: use an immersion blender to "crush" whole or diced canned tomatoes. pour off some liquid into your soup pot, then insert an immersion blender into th ecan and pulse to desired texture.

**Carrot Note**: Measure roughtly a heaping cup of sliced chopped carrots to yeild 1 cup minced. You can grate the carrot, or pop it in a mini food processor and pulse until minced.

**Fennel Note**: I quite like the flavor fennel seed adds to this sauce. If you think your kiddos might be fussy, use 1/4 teaspoon.

**Kitchen Tip**: Kitchen Tip: This makes a large batch, great for a large dinner party, or to freeze portions.
