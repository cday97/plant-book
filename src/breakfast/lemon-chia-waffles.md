# Lemon Chia Waffles
![This zesty version of waffles is an instant hit. these are also delicious without the lemon juice and zest and/or with 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries stirred in at th end. We recommend using a higher setting on your waffle iron to ensure they get a crispy crust and tender middle. They're yummy on their own or served with fresh berries and a sprinkle of hemp seeds.](../static/banners/lemon-chia-waffles.jpg)
