## Instructions
 1. Preheat oven to 350˚F and line a loaf pan with parchment paper or use a nonstick loaf pan.
 2. Place the bananas in a medium or large bowl and mash using a fork or potato masher. The bananas do not have to be completely smooth, it’s ok to have some small chunks for texture. Now, add in all the remaining wet ingredients with the mashed bananas and mix until everything is well combined.
 3. To a separate bowl add in all the dry ingredients and whisk them together. Then add to the wet and mix until everything is “just” combined. DO NOT OVERMIX. Think “pancake batter” consistency. A little thick with some lumps.
 4. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-50 minutes. The banana bread is done once you insert a knife or toothpick and it comes out clean. Keep in mind all appliances are different so cooking time can vary several minutes one way or the other.
 5. Remove the banana bread from the oven and let it cool for a bit in the baking pan. Then, carefully remove it and allow it to cool, preferably to room temperature, on a cutting board or cooling rack. The longer you let it set the easier it will slice. The texture and flavor will get better as well.
 6. Slice, serve, and enjoy!
