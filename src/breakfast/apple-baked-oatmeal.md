# Lemon Chia Waffles
![This is a baby and family friendly oatmeal recipe, using fresh apples and applesauce as a sweetener instead of any syrup or refined sugar. Canned pumpkin puree is added for both flavor and vitamin A. You also have the option to add dried fruit, like raisins or dried cranberries, and/or chopped nuts depending on your child's age. For infants, we recommend peeling and grating the apples for easier chewing.](../static/banners/apple-baked-oatmeal.jpeg)
